My Uni assignment using Tkinter and SQLite

I am making an interactive application (software) that enables the user, admin staff, and sales staff to have login access to the application by using email and password registration that will be saved in their corresponding databases.

I will have a backend SQLite database that contains the registered users, admin staff, and sales staff. Also, the database should have all the items in store with their corresponding code, name, quantity, and quantity left. In addition, the database should save the reference number of all transactions made.

I will also include a QR code of generated purchase or return receipts should be saved in the local directory of your developed software (application)
